# Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition - Final Project

> This repository tracks the development of encoder-decoder deep learning architectures toward Volumetric Images Segmentation (3D).

## Dataset

To download the dataset, please follow the instructions given at [RSNA-ASNR-MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Challenge 2021](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2021/). This project uses the dataset for task 1 (Predicting tumor segmentations). The instructions are under the **Registration / Data Request** sub-section.

The following papers provide a deeper explanation of the dataset structure (The first one focused on the 2021 Challenge):
